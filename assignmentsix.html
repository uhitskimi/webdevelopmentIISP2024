                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The weight of societal structure, having to act and pretend at all times, had been placed on Africans before they even set foot on the land of America. From the moment they are sold off, they are to act a certain way — well-behaved and nonviolent — and yet still were considered the bottom of the barrel humans despite this. The mask they wore was less of a choice and more life or death for them. To act anything other than cordial was to ask for any horrendous act their suppressor might dish out. Freedom was nonexistent, with restrictions to their status as human beings, the rampant colorism in the Black community, etc. The limitations placed on enslaved people is reflected on by the select media I will be exploring, expanding upon the wide variety of feelings gained from the loss of autonomy.  

                    The connection between these poems and story reveals the overwhelming tension and scarcity of freedom available to African Americans. No matter if a person was born free or not, in some grand or subtle way it would be taken from them because of the limitations.  </p>

                <h1>We Wear the Mask by Paul Laurence Dunbar</h1>
                <p>Dunbar utilizes the symbolism of a mask in his short poem as a façade, a burdening duty placed upon African Americans to behave in a way that would please their white counterparts — they conceal their expressions and hide any sort of discontent for the sake of making it home. The third line of his poem. “This debt we pay to human guile; With ... subtleties,” is a line that reflects on this burden being placed upon them, despite the horrendous injustice they had faced. Dunbar seems to have been at a loss and given up on being heard in this way, that his oppressors would not give his community the time of day to listen to their cries. No one cared to look deeper than this mask they wore, and it became a common tactic to survive amongst the black community. I would say, even today it is extremely common.</p>
                <p>Hope is lost to Dunbar, and he resorts to Christ for some sort of relief from the heavy weight of knowing he will never be heard, evident in his line, “We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries to thee from tortured souls arise.” There were a lot of reasons for African Americans to feel burdened, such as Jim Crow laws and living in fear, wondering if they would find themselves being kidnapped in the middle of the night for a crime they did not commit, or a minimal one at that. It must have been hard to watch their white counterparts commit those same crimes and not receive the extent of their punishment, being subjected to death as opposed to a minor fine or something of the sort.	 </p>

                <h1>If We Must Die by Claude McKay</h1>
                <p>What I observed in this poem was that McKay is extremely aware of the circumstances he is given and the burden to be faced. It is his reaction to it that is different to the other media presented in the essay. Death is seemingly inevitable in this era and fear keeps the Black community of their toes. They are going to do what it takes to survive, but Claude McKays response is a bold and direct response to something instilled into the community for hundreds of years. He faces the ugly circumstances of the Jim Crow laws, the unequal representation and opportunities, and fights back. McKay is content with a death knowing that he contributed to the ongoing fight of this, and it is honorable. Being written in the Harlem Rennaissance era, where there was overwhelming confidence growing for the community because everyone stuck together, I am sure many poems like there came about.  

                    “If we must die ... honor us though dead,” is a line that to me, represents his determination to have his white counterparts know there will be consequences to the injustices enacted upon him and others. While the poem might have not been for a white audience and more of a method to instill bravery in the Black community, for them to see it would be inevitable.  </p>

                <h1>Section Three</h1>
                <p>What I take away from the Passing novel is now understanding the things that mattered the most to the Black community in this era. Colorism was very rampant in this era, and the book reflects that; Irene had the slightest temptation to expose Claire to her husband to remove her from her own life. She had originally felt like she owed it to her to keep this secret, and in the end had used it against her. It shows the weaponization of colorism but extends far past that. To “pass” in this era means you must restrain yourself to the culture and traditions to one race only, which in this case, Claire had taken it further and risked living the life she truly wanted.  </p>
                <p>There is no doubt in my mind that Irene did not feel immense guilt about the death of Claire but looking at the jealously the two had for each other, the hints were subtle. Claire yearned for the life that Irene had committed to, and Irene desired to benefit from “passing” just as Clare did. On the of end Claire, she had been longing to be on the other side, enjoying the culture and traditions of Black Americans for so long that she could not contain herself.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>After looking at the various media presented and their responses to what the social norms were in this era, I have made an inference that the response to weight of societal norms came in many different forms; Dunbar had concealed his cries for help with a mask and looked to Christ for help, McKay was a brave man willing to give his life to an ongoing fight against injustice, and Claire and Irene were to use it for their benefit. Despite these different reactions, it is clear they would always hope for different circumstances. Every piece of literature examined is a representation of a wide variety of people, not only from this era but also from the generations before them.  </p>
