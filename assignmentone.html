        <h3><strong>NEW COMPETITION</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The fear that the author experiences regarding the quick advancement
          of artificial intelligence into the field of design is very valid.
          Changes in technology has almost always advanced at a gradual pace
          that is as a society can adjust to. Things are released in small
          increments through small updates, like the distance between the first
          computer system and implementing touchscreen abilities in 1983. Behind
          these updates was the excitement for something new that could change
          our lives for the better, as we were given the time to prepare.
        </p>

        <p>
          This current phenomenon, however, is coming at users all around the
          world hard and fast. Design had started as a human artistic trait with
          the combination of having to conduct studies on the human mind and
          analyzing patterns manually. When you take that entire process away
          from humans, the authenticity of and connection to art is disrupted
          and watered down to artificially intelligence remixing things humans
          have already done before. I’m not that up-to-date with artificial
          intelligence, but to my knowledge, somebody has to physically input
          the already existing information for these ideas and techniques to
          take flight. Jobs are indeed at risk; “As Jacob Nielsen … better than
          you do,” is a statement that accurately acknowledges the fast occuring
          changes that leave designers in a “survival of the fittest” mentality,
          scrambling to learn how to be better than artificial intelligence and
          incorporate it at the same time. The reality is, humans cannot compete
          with such a thing that holds more data than humans our brains can
          comprehend. So, I think in part of allowing AI to mold and shape our
          lives, there will also be laws implemented to protect the well-being
          of humans at the same time.
        </p>
        <h3>IS IT USEFUL</h3>
        <p>
          While artificial intelligence hasn’t proved to be exactly necessary to
          shaping designs, it has seemingly enhanced the ability to study any
          given data and recognize patterns, implementing algorithms based on
          user’s needs. “This beneficial capability … enhancing the overall UX,”
          recognizes how artificial intelligence has become a useful resource
          for businesses and caters better to algorithms for users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Incorporating artificial intelligence in this manner doesn’t seem all
          that harmful — similar to using Google for research compared to a hard
          copy book — allowing designers to put their skills to use and maintain
          authentic art and the connections people have to it. There should be a
          balance between the use of artificial intelligence and human
          authenticity so that the value of art isn’t diminished in the process
          of advancement.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>DRAWBACKS</strong></h3>
        <p>
          More on the negative impacts of artificial intelligence in art, I’ve
          encountered a lot of people fight back on it, even witnessed the
          original artists themselves find their original pieces of theirs
          floating around on the internet, altered slightly and untrue to their
          creation. This could evoke some self-doubt in an artist. I reckon over
          time that as the unrealistic body depictions and way too many body
          parts become a thing of the past, that it’ll be harder to tell what’s
          been artificially generated or not. Artists are now in competition
          with robots, knowingly or unknowingly, losing opportunities because
          people want cheaper and faster alternatives. Jobs could be run out of
          existence in the long-run and the drive to create art could be run to
          the ground. In addition to this, there’s always the possibility of
          artists who do create original art being accused of using artificial
          intelligence which robs them of being acknowledged for their hard
          work. This isn’t something that I’ve witnessed before personally from
          an original artist, but I don’t think it’s something that could be
          completely disregarded as a possibility. When it comes down to it,
          there seems to be some pros and cons of artificial intelligence in our
          lives that is here to stay.
